Intro

I am interested in how scale and the types and quality of data affect the outcomes of conservation planning and how quantitative computational tools and biodiversity conservation informatics can inform robust conservation decision-making. I am also increasingly interested in qualitative, interdisciplinary questions on how scientific information is used in societal decision-making and what constitutes policy-relevant research.
